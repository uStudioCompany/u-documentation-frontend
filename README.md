# uDocumentation

## Instruction for install in another repo

1. In your repo directory run command: `git clone https://github.com/uStudioCompany/u-documentation-frontend.git master --allow-unrelated-histories`
2. Create a file `config.json` in the root with the content as `config.example.json`. In this file you can specify the project name, color palette and mandatory settings for the application: name of the repository owner, name of the repository itself, working branch, and name of the folder from which navigation will be built.
3. To install your own logo, place the image with it at the root of the project. The file name must be `logo.svg`.
4. In the repository settings, enable the "GitHub Pages" option, select the branch `gh-pages`, directory `/` (root).
5. Change `REPO_NAME` to your repository name in package.json file (`line 10`).
6. Add new Action to your repository with free name and next content:

```yaml
name: Build and Deploy
on: [push]
jobs:
  build-and-deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout üõéÔ∏è
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
        with:
          persist-credentials: false

      - name: Install and Build üîß
        run: |
          yarn install --production=true
          yarn build
      - name: GitHub Pages
        uses: crazy-max/ghaction-github-pages@v1.5.1
        with:
          build_dir: dist
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

##Usage

###Navigation
In the left sidebar is navigation in application that builds from file structure, existing in your `docsFolder`.
All nested folders are opened by default.

###Path
To create a link to file that are in your repo you need to create a path from root, for example `[linkName](/data-set/category.json)`

###CSV Tables
You need to use CSV tables in your markdown file.
Just create link to file in your repo with extension `.csv`,for example`[](/data-set/PROZORRO-QuestionGroups.csv "Title")`.
You also can pick data you need from this table using special syntax like query params.
For example, if you need only 1,2 rows and 1-3 columns from the table `[](/data-set/PROZORRO-QuestionGroups.csv?r=1,2&c=1-3 "Question Groups")`.

###JSON Schemas
To use JSON Schema you just need to create the file with extension `.schema.json` in your repo and use it in your markdown file as link to file with your JSON schema, for example `[](/data-set/category.schema.json)`

###Dropdowns
If you need dropdown, you can use links like syntax to create it.
You just need to use link with `"$"`.

Example for code snippet in dropdown `[ { name: "12", age: 12 } ]($json "show code")`,
where `{ name: "12", age: 12 }` is your code, `$json` is your file extension with `$`, `"show code"` is dropdown title.

Example for text in dropdown `[## some text]($ "show text")`.
